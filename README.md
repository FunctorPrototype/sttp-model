* [sttp tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir): Typed API descRiptions
* sttp model: this project. Simple Scala HTTP model. Used by sttp client & sttp tapir

## Quickstart with sbt

Add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.sttp.model" %% "core" % "2.0.0-RC1"
```

## Contributing

If you have a question, or hit a problem, feel free to ask on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/softwaremill/sttp-model)!

Or, if you encounter a bug, something is unclear in the code or documentation, donâ€™t hesitate and open an issue on GitHub.

### Building & testing the scala-native version

By default, sttp-native will **not** be included in the aggregate build of the root project. To include it, define the `STTP_NATIVE` environmental variable before running sbt, e.g.:

```
STTP_NATIVE=1 sbt
```

You might need to install some additional libraries, see the [scala native](http://www.scala-native.org/en/latest/user/setup.html) documentation site.
